          I want to enter the teaching profession because I like teaching. 
        I want to teach because I want to convey to students my knowledge and passion for art. 
        I want to teach because I want to excel as a teachr.
         Also, I am thinking of starting a school or a preschool where the most innovative and creative students can excel in art.

        Teaching Diversity through Art will contribute to my career as a teacher. The course gave me experience in art education from kindergarten to high school. During this course, I watched a series of video clips and saw how other teachers apply different teaching strategies to teach students. The reflective writing on the video clips helped me understand better the educational theory and practicum. The course focused on observing the educational methodology in California to design lessons for students. Also, some TED Talks videos introduced me to famous researchers, writers, and teachers who stood out in the field. They inspired me and gave me more enthusiasm. The Meyers-Briggs Temperament Inventory test helps me better understand who I am as a teacher. By taking the MBTI test, I discovered my types of personality, my preferences, the preferences of others, and how to recognize them. As a teacher, MBTI will help me understand students and develop mindful lessons to meet their needs.

        Understanding Multiple Intelligences Theory helped me learn about myself as a teacher. The theory of Howard Gardner taught me that humans possess at least eight different kinds of intelligence, which are Linguistic Intelligence, Logical-Mathematical Intelligence, Spatial Intelligence, Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence, Musical Intelligence, Interpersonal Intelligence, Intrapersonal Intelligence, and Naturalist Intelligence, and they are different from one another. Multiple intelligences helped me discover my strengths and weaknesses. My predominant types of intelligence are Logical-Mathematical Intelligence, Linguistic Intelligence, and Spatial Intelligence. By studying the Multiple-Intelligences module, I understood that I possess Linguistic Intelligence as my predominant intelligence. By having this intelligence, I can develop good verbal, writing, and reading skills. My Logical-Mathematical Intelligence helps me think critically, both abstractly and conceptually, and to discern logically. My ability to think critically will help me develop Socratic questioning lessons for students. Knowing that Spatial Intelligence is one of my predominant multiple intelligences, I can plan my educational activities based on my spatial intelligence skills, such as drawing, etc. My ability to visualize accurately and abstractly will help me develop good lesson plans to help students learn better. Having knowledge about multiple intelligences and recognizing the teaching strategies of others will help me plan my lessons in different ways to make students acquire their necessary knowledge. Knowing my predominant intelligences, I can plan my lessons using my best teaching skills and use many ways to teach students. The lesson that I enjoyed the most in this module is Case #1129 because it helped me understand my intelligence better. Also, I liked Case #122 because the teacher's instructions were very efficient for students.

        Benjamin Bloom's new taxonomy will also contribute to my teaching strategies as a teacher by helping me to teach deep learning. Bloom's taxonomy has six levels. They are Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating. Teaching deep learning means using both stages of Bloom's taxonomy, lower-order and higher-order. Using Bloom's taxonomy, students will synthesize the information from their lower-order skills, Remembering and Understanding. The higher-order skills include Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating. Students who do not have lower-order skills cannot understand higher-order knowledge. In the Remembering level, the teacher should answer the question: Can students remember, recall, list, memorize, state, define, reproduce, or duplicate the information? At the Understanding level, students must be able to explain, discuss, describe, classify, identify, recognize, select, and locate concepts or ideas. In the Applying level, the students should know how to use, demonstrate, illustrate, interpret, or write the information. At the Analyzing level, students learn to distinguish, compare, contrast, differentiate, criticize, etc., different parts. The Evaluating level will help students to defend, justify, select, and evaluate a decision. At the Creating level, students learn to create, develop, design, write, etc., their products or points of view. All this knowledge will help me with my lesson plans and teaching students.

           Furthermore, I learned how to design an age-appropriate lesson for students. This knowledge will contribute enormously to my teaching career because I learned about different characteristics of children's development, such as physical, social-emotional, and cognitive development, which will help me know students and design age-appropriate lessons. Also, in this module, I learned different pedagogical approaches for early childhood, elementary, middle, and high school students and a guide from the Getty Museum Education Department that helps me recognize the students' abilities for each grade, from kindergarten to high school. Another contribution to my teaching career would be the habits of mind. They are: Develop Craft, Understand Art Worlds, Stretch and Explore, Engage and Persist, Reflect, Observe, Envision, and Explore. By recognizing the eight habits of mind, I know what instructions are better to meet the student's learning objectives. The habits of mind are non-hierarchical. At first, I was confused about how to convey to the students all these habits of mind, but after watching some video clips and doing my Observation Reflection #5, I understood them. I found Case #1168 interesting because the teacher demonstrated good teaching strategies and showed the quality of his instruction. All students in the class worked independently and were very engaged in their work

       As a person, by taking the MBTI test, I discovered my personality type. I am an ISTJ type, responsible, and realistic. I like to decide logically and have everything organized. As an "Introversion," I focus my ideas on the internal world, and as a "Sensing" person, I like to focus on concrete and present information. As a "Thinking" person, I make my decisions logically, and as a "Judging person, I like to organize my life and everything around me. The test caused me to explore not only my temperament and preferences but also to recognize the temperaments and preferences of other people. It helped me understand how to create differentiated opportunities for learning. As a teacher, by knowing my strengths and individual differences, I know how to approach different types of personalities and meet others' preferences.

        <h3>
        I experienced an "Ah-ha" moment when I discovered many teaching strategies and teacher behaviors. I understood that a teacher can influence not only the students' learning but also their behavior. By watching the video clips, students can see different ways of teaching and choose what works best for them. On the other hand, by observing a teacher in a classroom directly while teaching, students can acquire great real experiences for the beginning of their career, but there is the risk of thinking that that way of teaching is the best. Maybe combining both strategies is the best way to prepare students for teaching. By observing other teachers, I can compare their teaching styles and have a clear image of my strengths and weaknesses, and I can improve my weaknesses.
        </h3>
    <h3>
      When I have my class, I will apply all my knowledge acquired in this class to meet the student's learning needs. Teaching Diversity through Art will help me develop students' passion for art. I can design age-appropriate lessons by using pedagogical approaches and bringing to their classes the most beautiful and meaningful examples to inspire them and make them eager to discover the beauty of art as a tool to express their culture, feelings, and experiences. I can help students to integrate their culture into their community through their art to be part of the whole community and to respect the other cultures around them. As a teacher, I will allow students to express themselves by engaging them in discussions and asking questions to help them develop their communicative skills and make them aware of their participation in their community.
